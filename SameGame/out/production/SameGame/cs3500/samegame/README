I made one small change from feedback on my prior assignment which was to add a try and catch block
in the playGame methods in the SameGameTextController class to throw a specific error when the game
cannot be started. As for the changes I made with the addition of Gravity and AutoMatch same games,
I abstracted the totality of my original FourPieceSameGame class to an abstract class that is then
extended by the three model classes. The original swap, removeMatch, and startGames are changed
to protected helpers to allow for different methods to be called following their calling in
different classes. For examples, gravity being applied after a swap is made. Since
FourPieceSameGame implements the four methods by just calling the helpers, I did not create
tests for the protected helpers since they are being tested in my tests for FourPieceSameGame
and I would be testing the same code multiple times. The new functionality of both Gravity and
AutoMatch are tested in their respective examples classes.
